A curated list of resources to learn Mechatronics Engineering

Mechatronics gets together 3 engineering roles into one role. It consists of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer scientist.  
Mechatronics is made up of 6 main parts: Mechanical, Electronics, Robotics, Automation, Control, Programming.  
This list is inspired by this Quora post: https://www.quora.com/Im-looking-for-a-free-online-course-in-mechatronics-Where-can-I-find-one .

# Mechanical
There are 2 concepts to be learnt: Kinematics and Dynamics  
Kinematics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpWuZh6oTew . This video is Part 1. Watch the other parts (up to 4 parts).  
Dynamics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aMiZ3b0Ieg&list=PLRqDfxcafc206fNQPkcBUFEMYje-UjtqA

# Electronics
Key concepts of electronics are: electronic components, circuit designing, testing and debugging, PCB designing.  
Electronics also includes things like interface sensors, actuators and other communication devices with microcontroller or embedded systems.  
Search on YouTube or Google "Learn electronics".

# Robotics
There are 4 main categories of robotics: Drones, Autonomous Vehicles, Pick & Place Robots, Humanoid Assisstive Robots.  
Each of these categories needs specialisation in a particular domain (such as Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robot mechanics and control). 

# Automation
There are 2 types of automation: Hard Automation and Soft Automation.  
Hard automation is using PLC (Programmable Logic Control), sensors and actuators to automate processes.  
Soft automation is using artificial intelligence and robot vision guidance to automate processes.

# Control
When engineers test things in simulators, they usually miss out important factors such as friction or air resistance. 

# Programming
Programming languages you might use are: C, C++, C#, Embedded C, Python and ROS.  
Programming platforms you might use are: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, other microcontrollers.
